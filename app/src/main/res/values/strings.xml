    <item>a figure expressing the acidity or alkalinity of a solution on a
        logarithmic scale on which 7 is neutral, lower values are more acid
        and higher values more alkaline. The pH is equal to âˆ’log10 c,
        where c is the hydrogen ion concentration in moles per litre. </item>
    <item>
        The sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule,
        based on a scale in which the atomic masses of hydrogen,
        carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are 1, 12, 14, and 16, respectively.
